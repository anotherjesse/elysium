# Argus - AI+glasses terminal

## Hardware

- Khadas Edge2 ARM PC Pro Mini (linux machine the size of a deck of playing cards)
- VITURE Pro XR/AR Glasses â€” 135" 120Hz 1000Nits UltraClarity Display, Harman Audio, Myopia Adjustments, Electrochromic Film (USBC for power and DP / video out)
  - there is an SDK for linux - that should let me add some simple gesture controls, and control the Electrochromic Film (ECF) to switch between "sunglasses" and "black out" mode
- airpod pro 2 (or any bluetooth headphones, I just happened to have these)
- Tiktok Scrolling Ring (for simple control)
- Anker Zolo Power Bank, 20,000mAh 30W High-Speed Portable Charger with Built-in C Cable - I trust Anker and it provides 12V 2A profile required for the Khadas Edge2
- WiFi: either tethered to my phone or connected to home/office wifi


### Rejected Hardware:

- anything that doesn't have DP out for the glasses
- Orange Pi 5 Plus 16G with 256GB eMMC Module 
  - same processor as the Khadas Edge2, and cheaper - but it is bigger, and needs 5V 4A power..
  - RK3588 8 Core 64 Bit Single Board Computer, 2.4GHz Frequency Open Source Development Board Run Orangepi OS,Android,Debian,Ubuntu (Pi 5 Plus 16G+256GB eMMC)
